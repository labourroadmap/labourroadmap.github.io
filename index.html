<dl>
<dt>What is your vision for Labour?</dt>
<dd>The purpose of this project is to build a considered and evolving vision for Labour with the only precondition that it must be a relevant, pragmatic and can win.</dd>
<dt>What makes you different from other Labour groups?</dt>
<dd>Labour Roadmap is a project not a group. We have no membership, we have no narrow collective ideological commitment and we do not organise within the party.</dd>
<dt>Who are you?</dt>
<dd>We are active individual Labour party members who care about putting into power a just Labour government.</dd>
<dt>What is your view on the current plight of the Labour party?</dt>
<dd>We have no view beyond that we believe the party's results are not good enough. We are focused on helping prepare Labour for government and building a positive relationship with the British people.</dd>
<dt>How can I get involved?</dt>
<dd>Best way is to contact us by email. At time to time we may release a request for specific expertise so please regularly check the website and follow us on social media.</dd>
